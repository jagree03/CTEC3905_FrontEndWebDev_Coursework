## index.html

The `index.html` file includes a basic template with a link to the `css/styles.css` file and a script tag after the main content which links to the `js/scripts.js` file.

## css/styles.css

The `css/styles.css` file contains the styles for the page.

## js/scripts.js

The `js/scripts.js` file contains JavaScript code to operate the mobile menu and handles API requests alongside dynamically modifying the DOM to add article elements that are associated with the API Endpoint Response dependant on the user's search query.

## Project Description

This is my front-end web development project, "Projector Palace" which is a online streaming hub that provides services to users allowing them to watch movies. It is designed as a mobile device suited website. The Home page describes the qualities of the service and highlights any reasons as to why you should choose "Projector Palace" for your entertainment needs. The Purchase page shows a list of subscriptions on offer to access the streaming hub, a Film Search page connected to The Open Movie Database that can dynamically find and show the details of any movie that's within the database and a Contact page for the user to provide feedback into a form.
