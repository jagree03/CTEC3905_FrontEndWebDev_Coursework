## index.html

The `index.html` file includes a basic template with a link to the `css/styles.css` file and a script tag after the main content which links to the `js/scripts.js` file.

## css/styles.css

The `css/styles.css` file contains the styles for the page.

## js/scripts.js

The `js/scripts.js` file contains JavaScript code to operate the mobile menu and handles API requests alongside dynamically modifying the DOM to add article elements that are associated with the API Endpoint Response dependant on the user's search query.

## Project Description

This is my front-end web development project, "Projector Palace," an online streaming hub that allows users to watch movies. The website is designed to be mobile-friendly. The Home page outlines the features of the service and highlights reasons to choose "Projector Palace" for your entertainment needs. The Purchase page presents a list of subscription options for accessing the streaming hub. Additionally, there is a Film Search page connected to The Open Movie Database, which dynamically retrieves and displays details of any movie or TV show within the database. Finally, the Contact page allows users to provide feedback through a form.
